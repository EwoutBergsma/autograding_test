# Assignment 1
Details:
- Instructor: Ewout Bergsma
    - Email: e.bergsma@pl.hanze.nl
- Deadline: the next class
- Students work individually

Instructions:
- Do not change test_assignment.py
- Using `pip install -r requirements.txt` you can install all packages in one command
- If you want to unittest your own work locally simply use the command `pytest`
    - If you want to run a subset of the unittest: `pytest -k <substring> -v` where you replace `<substring>` with (part of) the test name (test names can be found in `test_assigment.py`)
- Do not have functions and variables of identical names within one Jupyter Notebook
    - This breaks the unittest (and is bad practise regardless)
- Open `assignments.ipynb` and follow the instructions there
